"""
The script calculates contour lengths - sum of orthogonals to flow directions 
(towards downslope neighbors), which equals to: 1) grid size for cardinal neighbors
and grid size*âˆš2 for diagonal neighbors (Freeman, 1991); 2)grid size*0,5 for cardinal neighbors
and grid size*0,354 for diagonal neighbors (Quinn et al., 1991); 3)grid size*0,6 for cardinal neighbors
and grid size*0,4 for diagonal neighbors (Wlock&McCabe, 1995) or 4) grid size multiplied by user-specified factors different for cardinal and diagonal directions.
Input Flow Direction raster is transfered to an array, for each cell of which
number of flow directions towards diagonal and cardinal neighboring cells is determined.
Accordingly, sum of contour length is calculated and converted to output raster.
